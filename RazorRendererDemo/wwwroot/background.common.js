// Because .Net is WebAssembly, it starts asynchronously and therefore cannot attach to events during the initial synchronous load.
// Service workers and other contexts expect the code to be ready to handle events after the initial synchronous load.
// To try and adapt this old fashioned synchronous startup to work with .Net we have to hold events until .Net is ready to handle them.
// !! IMPORTANT !!: The way this method works simplifies some things but can complicate others.
// Important part: Event data is held in a queue and eventually re-dispatched once .Net signals it is ready.
// This can cause issues if you have other listeners to these events outside of .Net.
